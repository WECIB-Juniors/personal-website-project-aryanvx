            <p>
                Hello! My name is Aryan Vyahalkar, and I’m a high school junior at Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnologies, studying both at WECIB and Wake Technical Community College,
                where I’m learning how to turn code into control and structure into freedom. My path in computer science isn’t driven by curiosity alone; it’s shaped by the pressure to push beyond limits.
                From long runs to late nights, I’ve learned that consistency isn’t luck; it’s the result of relentless effort under pressure.<br>
                <br>I’ve earned certifications like Python ITS, PCAP, CompTIA Network+, and Cisco Certified Support, but credentials only tell part of the story. What truly matters is how I use them to build tools, algorithms, and frameworks that bring order to complexity, even when the stakes are high.
                My current focus is on computer science, data structures, and automation, with one goal in mind: to engineer systems that amplify human discipline.<br>
                <br>If you’re working on something that demands focus under pressure, tests conviction, and refuses mediocrity, please reach out.
                Because in this world, the only thing that can turn coal into diamonds is pressure.</p>
