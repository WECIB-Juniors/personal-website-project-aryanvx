            <ul>
                <li><strong>Running:</strong> Currently, I run track & field and cross country with Green Hope High School. My times are as follows: 51.92 in the 400m, 1:58.776 in the 800m, and 4:34.14 in the 1600m.</li>
                <li><strong>Reading:</strong> When I'm not running, you can probably find me reading a book. I can read pretty much about anything, but my favorite book is <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em> by  Mohsin Hamid.</li>
                <li><strong>Coding:</strong> Like I said before, my mission is to engineer systems that will amplify human discipline. In fact, I'm working on this voice code studio that will allow physically impaired coders to also build stuff. Check out my GitHub if you're interested.</li>
                <li><strong>Listening to music:</strong> Music helps me relax and stay focused, whether I'm working or unwinding. My favorite artists are Yeat, Tame Impala, Ken Carson, and Don Toliver.</li>
                <li><strong>Watching movies:</strong> When I'm not doing the things I listed above, I'm probably watching movies. My favorite series of movies are the Fast and Furious franchise, and my all time favorite is <em>White Men Can't Jump</em>.</li>
